                    <p>Hello friends,</p>
                    <p>
                      The rapidly approaching New Year encourages us to reflect
                      on the year gone by –&nbsp; it also offers fresh starts
                      and new opportunities. This newsletter will update you on
                      some of our 2013 successes, and let you know about our
                      2014 initiatives. You can also read some of our team’s
                      personal New Year’s resolutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For me, 2014 will bring about significant changes. After
                      more than 20 years as President of Earth Day Canada, I
                      will retire early in the New Year. We have selected an
                      excellent replacement to take over the position – her name
                      is Deborah Doncaster, and you can read about her
                      impressive qualifications below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It has been an honour to meet and work with many of you
                      over the years. I wish you all the best this holiday
                      season, and in 2014!
                    </p>
                    <p>Jed</p>

                      Holiday shopping does a lot of damage to the environment –
                      not to mention our wallets. Instead, consider eco-friendly
                      alternatives like re-gifting, buying second-hand, creating
                      handmade presents or giving experiences instead of
                      objects. Remember: memories made together last far longer
                      than the “stuff” that clutters our homes or ends up in the
                      landfill.

                      The Beyond Green Environment Summit was a huge success.
                      For three days in October, over 900 young Canadians,
                      facilitators, organizations and inspiring environmental
                      leaders connected at the University of Toronto to explore
                      a diversity of environmental issues in hands-on workshops,
                      speaker panels and break-out sessions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Beyond Green was Canada’s largest and most dynamic
                      environmental youth summit to date! The event sparked
                      critical discussion and encouraged action across
                      disciplines and perspectives to create environmental
                      change. You can find photos of this game-changing Summit

                      The EcoMentors program is happy to announce that it will
                      be ramping up Toronto area trainings in 2014 with its
                      Youth Activator Network (YAN) – a group of three
                      EcoMentors facilitators, who were selected from a wide
                      pool of applicants to enhance our capacity to develop
                      young environmental leaders. Initial YAN training sessions
                      began in the fall of 2013 and will be continuing into the
                      New Year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      From January until May 2014, seven EcoMentors training
                      sessions will be offered in Central (Downtown), North
                      Western (Etobicoke and North York) and Eastern
                      (Scarborough) Toronto regions. These city-wide sessions
                      will increase our fast-growing network of environmentally
                      engaged young people, who will deliver workshops on issues
                      to school groups and peers in their local communities.

                      The Lower Mainland Green Team (LMGT) has used their
                      $10,000 cash-prize to build activities focused on engaging
                      youth (with a focus on at-risk youth) in experiential
                      environmental hands-on learning. Since being awarded the
                      Hometown Heroes Group Award in June 2013, LMGT has run
                      nine youth-focused stewardship and habitat restoration
                      events, engaging 205 youth in planting 1,545 native plants
                      and trees, and removing 450 pounds of invasive plants.
                      Winning the Hometown Heroes Award has allowed LMGT to
                      continue to make a long-term impact in their region and
                      provide youth with opportunities to take an active role in
                      helping the environment.

                      After over 20 years as Earth Day Canada’s President, Jed
                      is retiring. Though he will be missed, we are thrilled to
                      announce that Deborah Doncaster will be taking over his
                      position in early January!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Deborah Doncaster has spent over 20 years in the areas of
                      human rights, animal welfare, environmental conservation,
                      planning and stewardship, community power and green
                      energy. She has helped build Canada’s first
                      community-owned wind turbine on the Toronto Waterfront in
                      2004. While at TREC Renewable Energy Co-operative (TREC),
                      Deb helped found the Ontario Sustainable Energy
                      Association (OSEA), a member-based community organization
                      that saw the TREC turbine as a symbol of hope that Ontario
                      citizens could develop and own community-based,
                      non-polluting electricity generation.&nbsp; Under Deb’s
                      leadership, OSEA’s efforts resulted in Ontario’s Renewable
                      Energy Standard Offer Program in 2006, and the
                      establishment of the Community Power Fund (CP Fund) in
                      2007.&nbsp;

                    <p>
                      In 2008, she launched a multi-stakeholder campaign for a
                      Green Energy Act for Ontario, which passed into law in
                      2009. For her work on this act, Deb was honoured with the
                      City of Toronto’s Green Leadership Award for Market
                      Transformation.

                    <p>
                      Deb holds Master’s degrees in Law from Carleton University
                      (Ottawa) and Environmental Studies from York University
                      (Toronto). She lives in Toronto with her husband Ben and
                      son Devon.

                      Last year, we asked teachers who participated in our
                      EcoKids program to fill out a survey sharing their
                      thoughts on how we might improve the program. Based on
                      those results, we’re happy to announce that we will be
                      starting a brand new EcoKids Facebook Group in early 2014.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The group will serve as a place for teachers to connect
                      with one another, share resources and ideas and keep up
                      with the latest updates from Earth Day Canada. We look
                      forward to catching up with you soon!

                      TD Friends of the Environment Foundation (TD FEF) is proud
                      to support the important work of Earth Day Canada, and
                      hundreds of other environmental charities across Canada.
                      In 2013, TD FEF provided $4.4 million in funding to nearly
                      1,000 environmental projects. If you have a project that
                      needs funding – such as an outdoor classroom or energy
                      conservation project – consider applying for a TD FEF
                      grant. The deadline to apply to the first round of funding
                      in 2014 is February 15. To learn more and to apply online,

                      responsibility for buying the bottled water each week –
